    "#### b. Question: Why does using synchronous or asynchronous updating make adifference?\n",
    "In asynchronous updates, a node that would be infected by a neighbor at some time t would remain healthy if we happen to choose the infected neighbor in time t-1 and it recovers. This would not happen in synchronous updates, in which the infected neighbor can recover in time t but at the same time infect it's neighboor. Hence, whehther we do synchronous or asynchronous updates can influence the outcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### c. Question: For the mean field approximation described in Section 18.5, why is itappropriate to use the synchronous update method and not the asynchronous one?\n",
    "\n",
    "In mean field approximation we are calculating the probability that a healthy node will not be infected next, and this expression involves (1-p_eqp_i)^(n-1), which means that for every neighboor we check wether there is an edge, wether the neighbor is infected and whether the disease will be transmitted. Hence, the probability of being infected at the next step is assumed to be dependent on all the neighbors at the same time (rather than choosing a random neighboor and updating based on that). Note that synchronous updates is also how we updated CA for mean field approximation."
