Each year the investment grows according to an interest rate that is normally distributed with mean 8% and standard deviation 9%. At age 70, Fannie Mae then retires and withdraws \\$65,000 per year until death. Below is given a conditional death probability table. Thus if Fannie Mae lives until age 70, then the probability of dying before age 71 is 0.04979. Simulate this process 1000 times and histogram the amount of money Fannie Mae has at death."
